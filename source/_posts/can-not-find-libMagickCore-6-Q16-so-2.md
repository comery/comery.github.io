### display error
[Display](https://www.lifewire.com/display-linux-command-4091774) command in linux might be used often if you are using a linux/unix remote terminal on a windows or MacOS system. 

If you want to displat an image on remote host into local host, you must install xQuartz to MacOS or Xming to windows, and with [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) installed in remote linux system.

recently, I find an error : 
>display: error while loading shared libraries: libMagickCore-6.Q16.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

how it comes?

Because ImageMagick's lib directory does not add into your environment path. so just export /yourpath/imagemagick/lib

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/yourpath/imagemagick/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```
It troubled me for a long time, may it be helpful to you.

### trouble again
I have updated my ImageMagick to version 7.0.8-10 and add it to environment, but it still does not work!  
![WHY?](http://ogj9k5cjf.bkt.clouddn.com/heirenlian.jpeg)  
then I find command display I used is generated by libMagick version 6.0, so error occured:  
> display: error while loading shared libraries: libMagickCore-6.Q16.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

remove this```display```in your ```$PATH```, and ln -l new```display```to your environment.  

    ln -s /yourpath/imagemagick/bin/display /home/yourname/bin
