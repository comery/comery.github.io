>[Get someone's goat](http://www.24en.com/bbc/bbc3/2016-09-21/186654.html) 火冒三丈


#### Examples
These queues at the post office really get my goat. I've been waiting for half an hour!

Argh, I don't believe it – I've got a parking ticket! Traffic wardens really get my goat!

These calls from people selling insurance get my goat. They've rung seven times already this morning.

To get somebody's goat – an expression you can use when something annoys you.

注意，我们通常会在这个表达前用 really 来加强语气。比如 Train delays really get my goat. 火车延误特别让我恼火。
