## Backgrounding
  Today is really a remarkable day because I finally set up my personal blog website, which is an item lying in my plan for a long time. I find it is not so difficult to put it into practice, then I just chew some online post carefully, with just half a day on the basic deployment. So do it, writing your idea down if you are like me.
I look forward to the maximum of this blog is to record and inspire, recording my own inspirational ideas, whether it is about technology, politics, history, and even the fantasy, delusion, illusion, and some experiences in work routine, learning issues and the problems; I wish there is spark on accumulating after, and have a new eyesight out of  technology itself.
On the other hand, I want to adhere to originality. It is better to write down  my own "outputs", idea, thinking, scripts, the translation of things, of course, some necessary record issues will be recorded in it too, such as the English expression picked up, so those articles will be classified by classification tags:
  
	
### 1) Thinking
### 2) Scripts
### 3) Bio-Software-Using(BSU)
### 4) Reading
### 5) Learning
### 6) ...

 However, time will change something.
