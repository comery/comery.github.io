>[To make a mountain out of a molehill](http://www.24en.com/bbc/bbc3/2016-07-20/186371.html) 小题大做

我们多用这个表达来形容某人把一件小事故意扩大，使其看起来比实际的糟糕.

#### Examples:

I only asked him to do the shopping and now he's going on about how he has no time to go to the pub – he's making a mountain out of a molehill.

It's only a 2000 word essay; stop making a mountain out of a molehill!
